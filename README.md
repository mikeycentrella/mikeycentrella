- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikeycentrella
- 👀 I’m interested in agile software development and human centered design methods, how new technologies like 5G, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML), Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR), interactive and social video, and mobile edge computing (MEC) can enable new ways to engage people.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to integrate technology into brand experiences in a way that drives authenticity and human connection with an immersive experience
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on emerging tech projects
- 📫 How to reach me mikey.centrella@gmail.com
