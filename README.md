- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikeycentrella, In the past 20 years, my experience has been working with nonprofits and for-profits in the areas of product strategy, digital marketing, and tech innovation
- 👀 I’m interested in using agile software development and human centered design methods for learning how new technologies like 5G, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML), Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR), interactive and social video, and mobile edge computing (MEC) can enable new ways to engage people.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to integrate technology into brand experiences in a way that drives authenticity and human connection with an immersive experience
- 💞️ I’m open to new conversations on emerging tech, also happy to help with short term projects if I can.
